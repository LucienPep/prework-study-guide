# <Prework Study Guide Webpage>

## Description

This website is designed to be a learning aid for our pre course work for the University of Adelaide coding bootcamp. This website has been designed to show us the basic operations and functions of HTML, CSS, Git and JavaScript, by constructing a basic website where we can input notes of what we have learnt while taking the pre course. Further steps were taken with JavaScript to add a basic feature to the website. At all steps along the construction phase we used git hub and the git flow process to create branches and push them into our main branch to slowly create our website in an imitation of what we are likely to see in a workplace environment, with multiple users collaborating on one project. This project has given me the base skills I need to start the bootcamp confidently and start to process of computational thinking required to be a competent coder.

## Installation

## Usage

This website can be used to refer back to at any point when participating in the bootcamp. It contains useful notes and commands in each main block for HTML, CSS, Git and JavaScript that we are likely to use and build upon during the course. If The DevTools console is open you can also see a JavaScript function we built to decide which topic should be studied, this is implemented with a randomiser to make each users topic selection different.
